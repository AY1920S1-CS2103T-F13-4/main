<p>EzWatchlist is a desktop application that allows forgetful users to keep track of movies and tv series that they want to watch or have watched.
It was developed by a group of 5 students from the National University of Singapore taking the Software Engineering module including
myself under the premise that we had to either optimize or morph an existing <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/addressbook-level3/index.html">AddressBook</a> application. We chose the latter. Another
constraint was ensuring that the application has a command-line interface, which means that all commands should be executable through typing.
The picture below shows the various components of EzWatchlist.</p>

<h3 id="role"><a class="link" href="#role">Role</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was tasked with ensuring integration of the features of EzWatchlist. This means that I had to ensure that the commands
work with one another well and perform their expected functions in the respective pages. This was a challenge
since our application uses 4 different tabs, each with their unique functions and list of shows, so the implementation
of the commands would vary from tab to tab.</p>

<p>The <code>watch</code> feature allows users to update their watch list if a show has been watched.

<p>This enhancement resulted in a need to change the storage structure of the shows to include the episodes and tv seasons.
Its implementation was a challenge since it required structural change of the show objects, splitting them into movies and tv shows.
The addition of the clickable checkbox to mark or unmark shows also increased the difficulty of the implementation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sections showcases my contribution to the EzWatchlist Developer Guide. It exhibits my ability to use diagrams
and technical terms to inform other developers of how the features were implemented and the possibility
for enhancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="feature-mark-unmark-as-watched-feature"><a class="link" href="#feature-mark-unmark-as-watched-feature">[Feature] Mark/unmark as watched feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The watch feature allows users to mark or unmark shows as watched. It also allows users to keep track of the latest episode
of a TV series that they have watched.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mark/unmark as watched mechanism is facilitated by <code>WatchCommand</code> which can be found under the commands package.
It extends <code>Command</code> and uses the <code>WatchCommandParser</code> to process the command entered by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark as watched mechanism works at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application, and executes <code>watch 1 s/2 e/3</code> command to update the latest watched episode of the first show in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. Entering the command calls <code>WatchListParser#parseCommand()</code>, which in turn returns a new <code>WatchCommandParser</code> and the <code>WatchCommandParser#parse()</code> command is called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. A new <code>WatchCommand</code> is created, with the index of the show being parsed as a field of the <code>WatchCommand</code>. A new <code>WatchShowDescriptor</code> is also created to relay the episode number and season number to the <code>WatchCommand</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The <code>WatchCommand#execute()</code> method is called, referencing the current <code>model</code>, and the show that is in the current <code>FilteredShowList</code> is referenced based off the current <code>model</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
If the <code>index</code> is out of bounds, a new <code>CommandException</code> is thrown.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. A copy of the show is created through the use of <code>WatchCommand#createEditedShow()</code>, with the new total number of seasons and episodes updated if there are any changes.
A new <code>isWatched</code> value of the show is also determined based on the number of episodes that are watched.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following activity diagram below summarizes the calculation of the number of episodes watched:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. WatchActivityDiagram showing how episodes are calculated</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6. The show in the current show list is updated to the newly created copy with the updated watched status and latest episode watched, and a <code>CommandResult</code> with the new watched status of the show is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Creating a new <code>WatchCommand</code> class for changing the 'watch' status of a show.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Enables for greater cohesion since there is a specific command for editing the 'watch' status of a show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Requires longer code, and the code is also repetitive since its implementation is similar to that of the <code>EditCommand</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use the <code>WatchCommandParser</code> to create a new <code>EditCommand</code> object that edits the watch status of the show.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Less code repetition and shorter code in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This will mean that there is less cohesion of the code and greater dependencies since more classes depend on the <code>EditCommand</code> class.</p>
