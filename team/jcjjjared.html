<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EzWatchlist is a desktop application that allows users to keep track of movies and tv series that they want to watch or have watched.
It was developed by a group of 5 students from the National University of Singapore taking the Software Engineering module including
myself under the premise that we had to either optimize or morph an existing AddressBook application. We chose the latter. Another
constraint was ensuring that the application had a command-line interface.</p>

<h3 id="feature-mark-unmark-as-watched-feature"><a class="link" href="#feature-mark-unmark-as-watched-feature">[Feature] Mark/unmark as watched feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The watch feature allows users to mark or unmark shows as watched. It also allows users to keep track of the latest episode
of a TV series that they have watched.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mark/unmark as watched mechanism is facilitated by <code>WatchCommand</code> which can be found under the commands package.
It extends <code>Command</code> and uses the <code>WatchCommandParser</code> to process the command entered by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark as watched mechanism works at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application, and executes <code>watch 1 s/2 e/3</code> command to update the latest watched episode of the first show in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. Entering the command calls <code>WatchListParser#parseCommand()</code>, which in turn returns a new <code>WatchCommandParser</code> and the <code>WatchCommandParser#parse()</code> command is called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. A new <code>WatchCommand</code> is created, with the index of the show being parsed as a field of the <code>WatchCommand</code>. A new WatchShowDescriptor is also created to relay the episode number and season number to the WatchCommand object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The <code>WatchCommand#execute()</code> method is called, referencing the current <code>model</code>, and the show that is in the current <code>FilteredShowList</code> is referenced based off the current <code>model</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
If the <code>index</code> is out of bounds, a new <code>CommandException</code> is thrown.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. A copy of the show is created through the use of <code>WatchCommand#createEditedShow()</code>, which determines the new total number of episodes watched from the given seasons and episodes.
A new isWatched value of the show is also determined based on the number of episodes that are watched.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 6. The show in the current show list is updated to the newly created copy with the updated watched status and latest episode watched, and a <code>CommandResult</code> with the new watched status of the show is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the watch operation works:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Creating a new WatchCommand class for changing the 'watch' status of a show.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Enables for greater cohesion since there is a specific command for editing the 'watch' status of a show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Requires longer code, and the code is also repetitive since its implementation is similar to that of the edit command</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use the WatchCommandParser to create a new EditCommand object that edits the watch status of the show.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Less code repetition and shorter code in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This will mean that there is less cohesion of the code and perhaps greater dependencies since more classes depend on the EditCommand class.</p>
