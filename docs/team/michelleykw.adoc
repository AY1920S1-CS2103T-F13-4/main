== 1. Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my roles and contributions to the project, in terms of the code, the User
Guide and the Developer Guide.

=== 1.1 Overview

In a team of 5 software engineering students, we were tasked to enhance an existing desktop application,
link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/addressbook-level3/index.html[AddressBook], for our software
engineering project. We chose to morph it into a watchlist for movie and television series called
link:https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/main/index.html[EzWatchlist].

My role was to implement the `search` feature and ensure proper documentation of the code. I had
to implement the `search` feature such that users would be able to search within the watchlist and from online. The
code had to be refactored and the `search` command had to be modified to allow users to search for different
categories such as searching by name or actor.

=== 1.2 About EzWatchList

EzWatchList is a Command Line Interface desktop application, which means that it is designed for those who types fast
and prefer to execute commands through typing. It helps users, especially those who are forgetful, to keep track of the
shows they had watched or wish to watch, reducing the hassle of having to search for shows frequently.
