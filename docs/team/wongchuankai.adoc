== PROJECT: `Ezwatchlist`

== 1. Introduction

The purpose of the Project Portfolio is to document and showcase my contributions to the software project, `EzWatchList`.

Our team was initially tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface(CLI) desktop application
for our Software Engineering project. We are also allowed to morph it to other application that uses command line interface.
Thus, we chose to morph it into a movie records management system called EzWatchList. This enhanced
version provides a unique, clean and simple way of organizing and keeping track of movie or TV show watch list.

=== 1.1 Overview

Figure 1. The graphical interface for Ezwatchlist.

`EzWatchList` helps users to keep track and organise movie or TV show in a watch list. User can simply
interact with the application by inputting commands into the interface.

Main features of EzWatchList:

- Keep track of shows that users plan to watch
- Allows users to edit and mark down shows that they have watched
- Allows users to search for show online using `search` online function or search within user's watch list.
- Gives users statistics about their watching habits and recommend shows to them.

This symbol indicates important information.
API - Application programming interface. A sort of interaction with applications through software intermediaries.

A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.
VersionedAddressBook
Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== 2. Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project._
|===

My role was to design and implement the `Add` and `Sync` features. These commands are essential to the application as they are the
building block of the application. Before I can design these features, I have to understand
the application requirement first such as functional and non-function requirements. I also have to know who my target audience
is and study the use-cases properly to plan out and design these features.

=== *Major enhancement*:

==== Added ‘add’ and ‘sync’ commands.

Add command

*What it does*:

There are two functions for `Add` command.
Firstly, it allows the user to add movies or TV shows into the watch list.
User has to input several information of the show such as name, description, and
name of actors. Beside this core function, the add command also allows user to add a movie found in search
result page after user has used the `search` online feature. Search page displays the search result of the movies the user
is interested to watch. The `search` feature is implemented by my team mate.

*Justification*:

The purpose of this application is to allow user to track movie list. Thus, adding shows into watch list is a
fundamental and core function that runs the application. If the user wants to know more about a certain movie, he can
simply use the `search` function to search for it. The `search` function is able to gather information about movies online
and user can choose to ‘add’ a certain movie from the search list into his own watch list.

*Highlights*:



*Credits*:

Since we are retrieving information on shows online, we decided to use The Movie Database (TMDB) api.

Sync command

*What it does*:

There are two functions for `Add` command.
Firstly, it allows the user to add movies or TV shows into the watch list.
User has to input several information of the show such as name, description, and
name of actors. Beside this core function, the add command also allows user to add a movie found in search

=== *Minor enhancement*:

==== Added shortcut keys to move about pages easily.

*What it does*:

Users are able to press a single shortcut key button to move about the panels such as ‘Watchlist’, ‘Watched’, ‘Search’
and ‘Statistics’ without moving and clicking mouse.

*Justification*:

Our target user is one who prefers to type fast and complete tasks quickly. One of the non-functional requirement is to
reduce the usage of the mouse as this is mainly a command line application. Adding shortcut keys will reduce the
usage of the mouse.

*Highlights*:

*Enhancements to existing features* :

*Documentation*:

*Community*:

*Tools*:

*** Integrated a third party library (TMDB) to the project (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api[TMDB Api])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (Java wrapper) to the team repo.
*** Added a successfully merged pull request to the Java Wrapper we are using in our application to fix their issue of not supporting recommendations. (https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi/pull/111[Pull request merged])
