== PROJECT: `Ezwatchlist`
---
== 1. Introduction
The following Project Portfolio documents my contributions to the software project, `Ezwatchlist`.
Which was a project my team of software engineering students and I decided to pursue for our Software Engineering project.

Our team were initially tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop application that functioned as an Adressbook.
What this means is that the application focused on typing as the main mode of use, and had an existing rudimentary base of code already functioning.

Ultimately, we made the decision to modify it into a management application for Movies and Tv Shows named `Ezwatchlist`.

=== 1.1 Overview

Figure 1. The graphical interface for Ezwatchlist.

`Ezwatchlist` is an application that saves movies and television shows the user adds into a watchlist.
The user interacts with `Ezwatchlist` through typing commands or the graphical interface.
This enhanced application boasts the following features:

. Keep track of the movies and television shows that they planed to watch.
. Keep track of the movies and television shows that they have watched.
. Allow them to update the episodes they are at each television show.
. Get information about their watching habits.
. Get recommendations for movies and television shows.

API - Application programming interface. A sort of interaction with applications through software intermediaries.

A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== 2. Summary of contributions
This sections showcase my technical ability, This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

My main role was to design and write the codes for the integration with the application with an online database of movies and tv shows.
This was highly integral due to the nature and vision of the application where information about movies and tv shows
should be readily available to the user.

=== *Major enhancement*:
Added the ability for the application to integrate with an *online database of movies and tv shows*.

*What it does*:

. Allows the user to see images in the application
. Retrieve information about movies and tv shows
. Search for movies and tv shows from a large database
. Access reviews, ratings and other online centric data.

*Justification*:

This feature improves the product significantly because a user should be encourage to use the application by providing
appealing images, comprehensive information and up-to-date data.

*Highlights*:

This feature required a robust knowledge on how to set up third party libraries in a Java application.
Json conversion is also another key element when considering the API used.

*Credits*:

We are using The Movie Database (TMDB) API to retrieve information on movies and tv shows. As well as
using a java wrapper for the TMDB api implemented by Holger Brandl.


=== *Minor enhancement*:

added ability to get recommendations based on the user's personal movies and tv shows.

** Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can gain the added benefit of getting more suggestions for Movies and Tv Shows, which
makes the application more robust. Moreover, it might increase the usage of the application improving it's value proposition.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.3` (3 releases) on GitHub
*** Project lead, making sure the team coordinated and overall vision of the application was reached.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the Model to be null-friendly, and added Poster and Genre class (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
*** Helped to integrate the API code with the rest of the application.
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed : https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (TMDB) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (Java wrapper) to the team repo

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the original Ezwatchlist User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that
we had added. SHowcasing my ability to write to target user. The following is an excerpt from our OASIS User Guide, showing additions that I have
made for the undo and redo features.
This section also contains an excerpt for the data file encryption feature that I have planned for the
next version (v2.0) of OASIS. What I can do>
