== PROJECT: `Ezwatchlist`
---
== 1. Introduction
The following Project Portfolio documents my contributions to the software project, `Ezwatchlist`.
Which was a project my team of software engineering students and I decided to pursue for our Software Engineering project.

Our team were initially tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop application that functioned as an Adressbook.
What this means is that the application focused on typing as the main mode of use, and had an existing rudimentary base of code already functioning.

Ultimately, we made the decision to modify it into a management application for Movies and Tv Shows named `Ezwatchlist`.

=== 1.1 Overview

Figure 1. The graphical interface for Ezwatchlist.

`Ezwatchlist` is an application that saves movies and television shows the user adds into a watchlist.
The user interacts with `Ezwatchlist` through typing commands or the graphical interface.
This enhanced application boasts the following features:

. Keep track of the movies and television shows that they planed to watch.
. Keep track of the movies and television shows that they have watched.
. Allow them to update the episodes they are at each television show.
. Get information about their watching habits.
. Get recommendations for movies and television shows.

API - Application programming interface. A sort of interaction with applications through software intermediaries.

A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation
I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== 2. Summary of contributions
This sections showcase my technical ability, This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

My main role was to design and write the codes for the integration with the application with an online database of movies and tv shows.
This was highly integral due to the nature and vision of the application where information about movies and tv shows
should be readily available to the user.

=== *Major enhancement*:
Added the ability for the application to integrate with an *online database of movies and tv shows*.

*What it does*:

. Allows the user to see images in the application.
. Retrieve information about movies and tv shows.
. Search for movies and tv shows from a large up-to-date database.
. Access reviews, ratings, recommendations, collections of movies and tv shows, genre information, and much more.

*Justification*:

This feature improves the product significantly because a user should be encourage to use the application by providing
appealing images, comprehensive information and up-to-date data.

*Highlights*:

This feature required a robust knowledge on how to set up third party libraries in a Java application.
Json conversion is also another key element when considering the API used.

Moreover, I had to integrate this external data with our own internal systems. Meaning my teammates had to use my implementations easily. Hence, data handling and conversion had to be designed in an understandable manner.


*Credits*:

We are using The Movie Database (TMDB) API to retrieve information on movies and tv shows. As well as
using a java wrapper for the TMDB api implemented by Holger Brandl.


=== *Minor enhancement*:

Added ability to *store and retrieve images* in the application.

** Justification: This feature improves the visual interface, and provides movies and tv shows a more potent identity compared to just words.
** Highlights: A lot of consideration had to
be placed in the retrieval and presentation of images. I had to integrate the image portrayal with the `JavaFX`-based interface,
consider how to store images and retrieve them when needed.

=== *Minor enhancement*:

Added ability to get *recommendations* based on the user's personal movies and tv shows.

** Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can gain the added benefit of getting more suggestions for Movies and Tv Shows, which
makes the application more robust. Moreover, it improves the value of the application encouraging usage of the application.
** Highlights: This design for this enhancement had considerable thought into the efficiency of this feature due to the large amount of processing required from parsing the user's data.

*Other contributions*:

Project management:

*** I am the Project lead, thus my job consisted of making sure the team coordinated, the overall vision of the application was reached, and handling all the issues that arose in the development.

*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.3` (3 releases) on GitHub

*** Managed and assigned the issues, milestones and project board on Github.

Enhancements to existing features:

*** Updated the application's model to integrate seamlessly with the external library's data. This meant that each internal model class had to be error-friendly due to the unpredictable manner of the online database.
*** Added more internal classes such as `Poster` and `Genre` to be used in the application. (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
*** Helped to integrate the API code with the rest of the application.

Documentation:

*** Did cosmetic tweaks to our website. https://github.com[#14]

Community:

*** Reviewed Pull Request : https://github.com[#107], https://github.com[#30], https://github.com[#73], https://github.com[#51], https://github.com[#78]
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-3/main/issues[T11-3 team], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/20[F12-4 team]

Tools:

*** Integrated a third party library (TMDB) to the project (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api[TMDB Api])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (Java wrapper) to the team repo.
*** Added a successfully merged pull request to the Java Wrapper we are using in our application to fix their issue of not supporting recommendations. (https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi/pull/111[Pull request merged])


== 3. Contributions to the User Guide
Our Ezwatchlist user guide consists of instructions to the user on how to use our application. Thus, the following showcase my ability to write to target user in an intuitive and understandable format.
The following is an excerpt from our Ezwatchlist User Guide, showing additions that I have
made for the undo and redo features.
This section also contains an excerpt for the data file encryption feature that I have planned for the
next version (v2.0) of OASIS. What I can do>
