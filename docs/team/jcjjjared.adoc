This document serves to show the various contributions that I have made in the development of https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/main/index.html[EzWatchlist]
in a concise and understandable manner.

== More About The Project
EzWatchlist is a desktop application that allows forgetful users to keep track of movies and tv series that they want to watch or have watched.
It was developed by a group of 5 students from the National University of Singapore taking the Software Engineering module including
myself under the premise that we had to either optimize or morph an existing https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook] application. We chose the latter. Another
constraint was ensuring that the application has a command-line interface, which means that all commands should be executable through typing.

=== Main Features
* Adding, editing and deleting shows
* Keeping track of shows and episodes that are watched
* Online search and syncing of shows
* Statistics about user's watchlist

[NOTE]
Highlighted words indicate commands or components of the application. Eg. `watch` command, `WatchCommand` class

== Summary of Contributions

This section provides an overview of the contributions that I have made to the development of EzWatchlist. It also
showcases some of my coding and documentation abilities, and the challenges I faced during the development of EzWatchlist.

=== Role
I was tasked with ensuring integration of the features of EzWatchlist. This means that I had to ensure that the commands
work with one another well and perform their expected functions in the respective pages. This was a challenge
since our application uses 4 different tabs, each with their unique functions and list of shows, so the implementation
of the commands would vary from tab to tab.

=== Major Contributions

==== Implemented the `watch` feature

===== What it does

The `watch` feature allows users to update their watch list if a show has been watched.
It also helps users to keep track of where they are in a TV series in terms
of seasons and episodes.

===== Justification
The `watch` feature enables users to keep track of shows that they have and have not watched so that they can plan
out what they want to watch in the future.

===== Highlights

This enhancement resulted in a need to change the storage structure of the shows to include the episodes and tv seasons.
Its implementation was a challenge since it required structural change of the show objects, splitting them into movies and tv shows.
The addition of the clickable checkbox to mark or unmark shows also increased the difficulty of the implementation.

=== Minor Contributions

* Separated the the watchlist into different sections (not watched and watched).
* Changed the storage structure of the shows to save them as either movies or tv shows. This feature was
implemented with the intention of possibly retrieving season and episode details future versions.
