== Introduction

`EzWatchList` is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing movies and tv series watchlist*. More importantly, `EzWatchList` is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

.  If you can type fast, `EzWatchList` works faster than traditional GUI apps.
.  Keep track of movies and tv shows that you plan to watch or have watched.
.  Access quick information about your favourite shows through our online database.
.  Discover your personal movie habits, with our statistics page.
.  Can't find any good shows to watch? We will give you recommendations on what to watch based on your `Ezwatchlist` usage.
